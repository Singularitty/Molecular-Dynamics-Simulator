# Molecular-Dynamics-Simulator
Molecular dynamics simulator implemented using the Verlet Algorithm.

- Currently has the Lennard Jonnes potencial and a elastic monopole pair potential (equivalent to eletrostatic monopole) implemented. These can be switched by uncomenting sections regarding these potentials in the main cpp file.
- Outputs particle positions to a positions.xyz file, which can be viewed using a software like OVITO.
- Outputs potencial, kinetic and total energy per timestep in a diferent file called energy.txt.
