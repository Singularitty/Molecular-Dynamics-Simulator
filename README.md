# Molecular-Dynamics-Simulator
Molecular dynamics simulator implemented using the Verlet Algorithm.

- Currently has the Lennard Jonnes potencial implemented, but this can be easily switched.
- Outputs particle positions to a positions.xyz file, which can be viewed using a software like OVITO.
- Outputs potencial, kinetic and total energy per timestep in a diferent file called energy.txt.
